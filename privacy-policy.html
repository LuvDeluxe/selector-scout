    <title>Privacy Policy for Selector Scout Chrome Extension</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: September 12, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Selector Scout is a Chrome extension designed to assist web developers and
      QA automation engineers in generating CSS selectors and detecting
      accessibility issues on the active webpage. We are committed to protecting
      your privacy and ensuring the security of your information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal
      information or user data. It operates entirely locally within your
      browser:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you activate the extension, it temporarily accesses the DOM
        (Document Object Model) of the current webpage via the "activeTab"
        permission to analyze elements for selector generation and accessibility
        checks.
      </li>
      <li>
        No data is saved beyond the current session, and nothing is sent to
        external servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the extension uses local storage (e.g., for user preferences like
        framework selection), this is limited to non-sensitive, anonymized
        settings stored only on your device.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
      Any temporary access to webpage content is solely to provide the
      extension's core functionality. We do not use, share, or process this
      information for any other purpose, including analytics, advertising, or
      personalization.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share any user data with third parties. All processing happens
      locally on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>No data is retained after you close the extension or browser session.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy if the extension's functionality changes. We'll
      notify users via the Chrome Web Store.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>

      user data.
